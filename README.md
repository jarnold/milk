ETC cloud API framework project

The Entertainment Technology Center @ the University of Southern California (ETC)
 http://www.etcenter.org/ formally launched “Production in the Cloud,” a new
 project that brings together a core group of key media and cloud-resource leaders
 to develop guidelines and accelerate innovation and adoption of next-gen cloud-based
 content creation, production, and distribution tools and processes. Senior executives
  from the six major studios in coordination with Rackspace, EMC, EVault,
  Front Porch Digital, Google and other cloud companies convened recently to serve
  as governing body to collectively guide this process. The project is looking at the
  life cycle of film and media production, from pre-production collaboration, production,
  post production and through to archiving.

This specific part of the effort is around

* Bringing together various competitive organizations to work on a common goal
* Goal of developing an interoperable cloud framework
* First steps of socializing well underway
* Next important step of creating a prototype was discussed in October
* Now we need to execute on design and implementation
